A simple and cost-effective meal you can create with those ingredients is a rice bowl topped with strawberries. 

Recipe:
- Cook the rice according to package instructions. 
- Wash and slice the strawberries.
- Serve the cooked rice in a bowl, top it with fresh strawberry slices.
- Serve with a glass of milk on the side.

This meal provides a good balance of carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals from the rice and strawberries, as well as protein and calcium from the milk. The total cost of this meal would be approximately $4.0 (rice: $1.5 + strawberries: $2.5 + milk: $1.8).
